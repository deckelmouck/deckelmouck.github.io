#### Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results

Yesterday I finished my first book in 2021. I just needed two weeks and learned a lot for myself and about the process to get better and reach some goals I want to get checked in 2021.
So, my first change was to adjust my goals and divide them into smaller steps and some new habits to get a better track of these small issues.

### first release on GitHub
